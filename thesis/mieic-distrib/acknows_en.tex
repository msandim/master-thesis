\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First of all I would like to thank my supervisors, Dr. Carlos Soares and Dr. Bernhard Pfahringer, for guiding me throughout this dissertation topic and pointing me in the right directions when developing this research work.

I would like to thank Daniel for all the support given and kind words in the right moments, my family and my friends João, Ana, Paula, Luís, Susana and Raquel for all their support.
Without them, I know that I would not have been as successful as I was on my research.

Finally, I would like to thank Cláudio Sá, Tiago Cunha, Pedro Ribeiro, Fábio Pinto and Pedro Abreu from INESC TEC for their valuable insights, brainstorming sessions for this dissertation and kind availability to help me.
