\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work} \label{chap:conc}

\section*{}

This chapter will present preliminary conclusions of the work developed so far, as well as the future work planning.

\section{Conclusions}

The work developed so far allowed to conclude that the application of Ensemble Learning to Anomaly Detection is a novel research topic within Data Mining and that this topic reveals potential for improvement. 

However some difficulties are also reported throughout the literature \cite{Aggarwal2013, Zimek2014}, the most critical being the difficulty to adapt known Ensemble Learning methods to unsupervised learning (which is reported as being the most common learning mode in Anomaly Detection).

\section{Future Work}

As proposed in chapter \ref{chap:metho}, this thesis will follow a two-iteration methodology. Figure \ref{fig:gantt} illustrates the planning for the future work as a gantt chart.

This planning will be described in detail on a weekly basis in this section.
